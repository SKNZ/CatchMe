CatchMe
=======

Can you catch Oussama ? I wish I could.

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed on your system:
libboost-all-dev

A simple apt-get install should suffice, provided that you are running on a Debian-like distribution.

Due to the broken computer setups that you might be working on (-> IUT), you'll need to download the cmake .tgz file from CMake official site, the GCC package from Casali's website and use the parameters found for GCC in the 'alias' file to setup GCC in CMakeLists at the root of the project.
Should this not work for you, feel free to contact me at florandara@gmail.com for further information.
For information, I did manage to have it build and run on a computer at the IUT.
